Project

Name / short description

What worked well Well the apis that were imported were relatively easy to setup, simple plug n play.

What broke / where he got stuck, well tbh not much, but like ig the params that were supposed to be put in the terminal were sorta tricky to get up and running (first time so i had to figure it out) and stock api was also (Im not a stocky bro lmao)

Workarounds or hints you had to give. Well not much cus i just figured it out myself, but youtube, docs n stuff.

Skills/concepts he actually used (measurable) Terminal params (Like the tools in terminal use), and like api importing (ik how to use them but still lol)

Gaps exposed (missing knowledge, context collapse) not much this one was pretty easy.

Emotional signal (frustration / flow / boredom) Stock api was abit annoying at first (I do NOT know jackshit about stocks lol) but i EVENTUALLY figured it out.

Changes needed for beta (scope / clarity / scaffolding) Bro gave me some info about the stocks.

🔄 General Notes (per week, not per project)

Patterns in his struggles Where AI was misused or helpful Pace too slow / too fast? Did he “ship” something that felt real?
